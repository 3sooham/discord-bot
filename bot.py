# A Bot is a subclass of Client that adds a little bit of extra functionality that is useful when you’re creating bot users. 
# For example, a Bot can handle events and commands, invoke validation checks, and more.
# In general terms, a command is an order that a user gives to a bot so that it will do something. 
# Commands are different from events because they are:
# Arbitrarily defined
# Directly called by the user
# Flexible, in terms of their interface
# In technical terms, a Command is an object that wraps a function that is invoked by a text command in Discord. 
# The text command must start with the command_prefix, defined by the Bot object.
bot = commands.Bot(command_prefix='!')

# As you can see, Bot can handle events the same way that Client does.
@bot.event
async def on_ready():
    print(f'{bot.user.name} has connected to Discord!')

# Instead of using bot.event like before, you use bot.command(), passing the invocation command (name) as its argument.
# The function will now only be called when !99 is mentioned in chat. 
# This is different than the on_message() event, which was executed any time a user sent a message, regardless of the content.
# Any Command function (technically called a callback) must accept at least one parameter, called ctx, which is the Context surrounding the invoked Command.
# Keep in mind that all of this functionality exists only for the Bot subclass, not the Client superclass.
